\title{Binary Segmentation for covariance change points detection through Operator Norm.}
\usage{
BS.cov(X, s, e, level = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A \code{numeric} matrix of observations with with horizontal axis being time, and vertical axis being dimensions.}

\item{s}{A \code{integer} scalar of starting index.}

\item{e}{A \code{integer} scalar of ending index.}

\item{level}{A parameter for tracking the level at which a change point is detected. Should be fixed as 0.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with the structure:
\itemize{
 \item S:           A vector of estimated changepoints (sorted in strictly increasing order).
 \item Dval:        A vector of values of CUSUM statistic based on KS distance.
 \item Level:       A vector representing the levels at which each change point is detected.
 \item Parent:      A matrix with the starting indices on the first row and the ending indices on the second row.

\description{
Perform binary segmentation for covariance change points detection through Operator Norm.
