The goal of changepoints is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of changepoints from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("HaotianXu/changepoints")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(changepoints)
## basic example code
delta = 5
sigma2 = 1

set.seed(0)
y = c(rep(0, 50), rep(2, 50), rep(0, 50), rep(-2, 50)) + rnorm(200, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(sigma2))
n = length(y)
gamma_set = c(0.01, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50)
DP_result = CV.search.DP.univar(y, gamma_set, delta = 5)
min_idx = which.min(DP_result$test_error)
cpt_DP_hat = unlist(DP_result$cpt_hat[[min_idx]])
cpt_DP_LR = local.refine.univar(cpt_DP_hat, y)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
